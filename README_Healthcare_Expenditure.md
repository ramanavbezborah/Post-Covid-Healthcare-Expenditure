## 📘 Overview
Healthcare expenditure significantly impacts both national economies and public health. This analysis investigates how countries allocated healthcare funds between 2019 and 2022, with a spotlight on shifts induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. From economic resilience to life expectancy, our research connects spending to outcomes that shape lives.

## 💡 Key Insights
1. **Disparity in Funding Capacity** — Wealthier countries rapidly increased budgets; poorer nations struggled.
2. **Spending vs. Life Expectancy** — Correlation exists, but not perfectly linear due to system inefficiencies.
3. **Geographic Inequality** — Clear divide in per capita and GDP-based spending.
4. **Economic Capacity Isn't Everything** — Policy priorities matter. E.g., Brazil's public care model.

## 📄 Conclusion
Post-COVID healthcare spending has amplified both economic resilience and vulnerability. High-income nations leveraged their budgets for swift action, while many low-income countries continue to rely on aid and long-term support. The global community must address these imbalances for a more equitable, sustainable health future.
